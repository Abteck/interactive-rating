## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I never imagined i'd use the javascript length property in this project. I got stucked on how to count the total number of divs/span inside a container(counting the children in a div). After much thought i then figured i had to use '.length' property to get the sum of the active/selected divs and not loops.
